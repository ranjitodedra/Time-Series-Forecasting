# Time Series Forecasting

Time Series Forecasting for Financial Markets: This project involved the development of a robust time series forecasting model for Yahoo stock prices. We employed a comprehensive time series decomposition analysis to break down the stock price data into its constituent components, namely trend, seasonality, and residuals. Through insightful visualizations, we gained a deep understanding of how these components interacted over time, providing valuable insights into the stock's historical behavior. This analysis serves as a crucial foundation for making informed predictions and decisions in the dynamic world of financial markets.
